# pomodoro-clock
Created a pomodoro clock with Vanilla JS and CSS Flexbox. 

Once started, the timer counts down 25 minutes of work, indicates it is break time,
counts down five minutes, and creates a new 25 minute work session. The work / break cycle continues
until the timer is stopped or reset.

The user is provided with default controls (play,pause,stop,reset) and the ability to change
work / break sesssion durations.
